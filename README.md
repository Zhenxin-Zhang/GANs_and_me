# Welcome to GANs_and_me

Hi, I'm Zhenxin. I study Statistics and Machine Learning at CMU. And I'm a software engineer at Meta.

When I'm not coding, I'm creating posters and drawings. And I love combing engineering and art :)

Now I'm learning Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) via building Basic GANs!
