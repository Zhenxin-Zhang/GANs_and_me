# Welcome to GANs_and_me

Hi, I'm Zhenxin. I studied Statistics and Machine Learning at CMU. Currently I'm a software engineer at Meta.

Now I'm learning Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and building interesting GANs!

The course I'm taking: https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-basic-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/home/info
